# FLASK_ShoppingList

Just a little local-webapp to start studying database and server approach through APIs.
Everything is made using Flask and i've made this shopping list just to approach this framework for a bigger project.

To run the file, install flask and in your local repository, enter the commands lines =>

  &nbsp;[LINUX]:\
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;export FLASK_APP=app.py\
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;export FLASK_ENV=development\
  &nbsp;[WINDOW]:\
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set FLASK_APP=app.py\
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set FLASK_ENV=development\

        
After that, use the command `flask run` to start the server.
If any error occures, try `python -m flask run`.
